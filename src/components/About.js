        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a dedicated and results-driven <strong>Frontend Engineer</strong> with over 1.6 years of professional experience in building user-centric web applications and
            business intelligence dashboards. Currently, I am working in a technology-driven environment where I specialize in creating responsive and interactive UIs using{' '}
            <strong>React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</strong>.

            As part of my current role, I also work with <strong>Apache ECharts</strong> to develop data-rich visualizations, and I leverage <strong>TanStack Query</strong> for
            effective state and server data management. My focus is on delivering clean, scalable, and performant user interfaces.

            Previously, I worked as a <strong>Software Engineer at Genpact</strong>, where I collaborated with cross-functional teams to analyze and visualize workforce data using
            tools like <strong>Power BI, Tableau, SQL, and Excel</strong>. I played a key role in creating data-driven reports that supported productivity improvements and
            decision-making.

            I bring a unique blend of frontend development and data visualization expertise, and I’m currently expanding my skillset toward <strong>Full Stack Development</strong>{' '}
